# Synchronization Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Bluetooth-based synchronization feature between two instances of the application. The feature allows users to sync product and category data between devices, with conflict resolution based on last modified timestamps.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Bluetooth Communication Layer
- **Bluetooth Permissions**
  - Add required permissions to AndroidManifest.xml
  - Implement runtime permission requests for Bluetooth
  - Handle Bluetooth enable/disable states

- **Bluetooth Device Discovery**
  - Implement device discovery for nearby Bluetooth devices
  - Filter devices to show only those with the app installed
  - Display discovered devices in a user-friendly list
  - Handle device pairing/unpairing

- **Bluetooth Communication**
  - Implement BluetoothSocket for device-to-device communication
  - Create a protocol for data exchange (JSON-based)
  - Implement connection retry logic
  - Handle connection timeouts and errors

### 2. Data Model & Serialization
- **Data Classes**
  - Category: {id, name, lastModified}
  - Product: {id, name, categoryId, quantity, lastModified}

- **Serialization**
  - Implement to/from JSON conversion for data classes
  - Compress data before transmission
  - Handle data chunking for large datasets

### 3. Synchronization Logic
- **Synchronization Protocol**
  1. Sender discovers and connects to receiver
  2. Sender sends all categories and products
  3. Receiver processes incoming data:
     - Adds missing categories
     - For each product:
       - If doesn't exist → add
       - If exists → keep version with latest lastModified
  4. Receiver sends back its data
  5. Sender applies same logic as in step 3
  6. Show completion dialog

- **Conflict Resolution**
  - Always preserve the record with the latest lastModified timestamp
  - If timestamps are equal, keep both versions

### 4. User Interface
- **Synchronization Screen**
  - Button to start device discovery
  - List of available devices with connection status
  - Connection progress indicators
  - Sync progress bar
  - Completion dialog with results

- **Error Handling**
  - Connection failures
  - Timeout handling
  - Data validation errors
  - Permission denials

### 5. Testing Plan
- **Unit Tests**
  - Data serialization/deserialization
  - Conflict resolution logic
  - Data model validation

- **Integration Tests**
  - Bluetooth discovery and pairing
  - End-to-end synchronization between two devices
  - Offline/online scenarios

- **UI Tests**
  - Device discovery UI
  - Connection flow
  - Error scenarios

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Bluetooth Implementation
- Set up Bluetooth permissions and basic discovery
- Implement device pairing
- Basic device-to-device communication

### Phase 2: Data Synchronization
- Implement data serialization
- Create sync protocol
- Implement conflict resolution

### Phase 3: UI Implementation
- Build device discovery UI
- Create sync progress screens
- Implement error handling and user feedback

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
- Comprehensive testing across devices
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinements

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Bluetooth Connection Stability**: Implement robust reconnection logic
- **Large Data Transfers**: Add progress indicators and chunking
- **Battery Impact**: Optimize Bluetooth usage and add battery level checks
- **Security**: Add basic pairing verification

## Future Enhancements
- Support for partial synchronization (only changed items)
- Multi-device synchronization
- Cloud backup integration
- Conflict resolution with manual merge option

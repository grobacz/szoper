# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document captures the key architectural decisions made during the development of Szopper, including the reasoning behind each choice and considered alternatives.

## ADR-001: Clean Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-07-19  

### Context
The application requires a maintainable, testable architecture that separates business logic from framework dependencies and allows for easy testing and future modifications.

### Decision
Implement Clean Architecture with three distinct layers:

- **Data Layer**: Repositories, database, network implementations

### Reasoning
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Framework Independence**: Core business logic isn't tied to Android frameworks
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and modify existing ones

### Alternatives Considered
- **MVVM only**: Insufficient separation for complex business logic
- **MVP**: More boilerplate and harder to test
- **MVI**: Overkill for this application's complexity

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High testability, clear structure, framework independence
- **Negative**: More initial setup, additional abstraction layers

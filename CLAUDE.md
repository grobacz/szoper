# Project idea

1. A mobile app running on android phone
2. I can create a list of products to shop for
3. I can mark products as bought, so they are presented differently from not  marked products on the list
4. I can reset state of all products to unmark them, with one click
5. I can synchronize the list in it's current state between devices, without use of the internet, e.g. with wifi direct, bluetooth or other way

# Project preferences

1. Project is written in Kotlin
2. Local database in MonogoDB Realm, which should simplify synchronization feature
3. Modern UI with dark theme
4. Dependency injection library, for transparent injection of services and clean architecture
5. End-to-end test suite for all features
6. Static analysis and lint libraries ensuring code quality

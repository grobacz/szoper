# New feature requests:
1. allow drag and drop on the list, to be able to re-order the items. Item position on the list should become part of it's properties, and be accounted for during synchronization
2. add option in settings to disable haptic feedback on UI clicks. when disabled, list item clicks (marking and unmarking), adding item and other buttons should not cause vibrations
